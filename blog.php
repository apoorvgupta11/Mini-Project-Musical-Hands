                    <h2>Laney Minis- The ideal companion for guitarists and bass players</h2>
                    <h5>Instrument guide, Sep 2, 2020</h5>

                    <p>Portable guitar amps are very important to make regular practice possible. Whether you are a touring guitar player or a bedroom musician or even just beginning your journey on an electric guitar, an amplifier that is a portable
                        solution is pretty handy at all times. Like most guitar players, we always want those extra effects such as distortion, delay, reverb, chorus, flanger, phaser and so on. An interesting product that brings all of these to life
                        is the Mini series of amps from Laney. These amps are as compact as your regular portable bluetooth speaker and can do wonders if you are looking for a travel amp or even if you’re just happy to have a practice amp sitting
                        neatly on your desk.

                        Laney introduced around 3 models for guitarists that are part of this series in addition to 3 colour options for each model. These models power between 3 to 6 watts and are a perfect solution if you’re actually considerate
                        about the neighbours but also packs a punch! All of these models have an independent Drive button that lets you dive straight into a dirty patch.

                        Let’s get into the different models in this series for guitarists. The entry model in this series is a simple 3 watts amp with a 3 inch speaker cone to keep your practice loud enough for your listening only. The next in the
                        series are the 6 watts dual speaker cones thus doubling the wattage power. This model is what they refer to as the Stereo version (2 speakers x 3 watts). This model also adds in a level knob for your gain as well as level knob
                        for the factory preset tape delay which is also included. The final model in the series is a clone of the Stereo version but with the option of connecting a bluetooth source for playback. All 3 of the above models support an
                        aux input as well so you can always jam to your favourite songs while you play through the amp. Each of these models comes in 3 colour options namely the Ironheart, Lionheart and SuperGroup. They are by no means modeled to
                        sound parent models but merely just classify as colour options. The Lionheart colour is definitely a favourite!</p>
                    <p>Now let us dive into the effect section. Interestingly the effect section is controlled via an LSI (Laney Smartphone Insert) input into your phone. It is a regular 3.5mm port that you usually connect your earphones to. This
                        section offers a wide range of effects on a phone app called Tonebridge. Once you log in to the Tonebridge app you will find a huge catalog of Artist preset tones that you can dial into and tweak. You can also access a wide
                        array of amp modelling options, along with various pedalboard combinations and play along to your favorite artist tracks.

                        Lastly, there is also an additional model Laney have designed for Bass players too called the Nexus Mini. The interface is similar to the guitar amps but instead of a Drive option on the guitar amps we have a shape option just
                        like the actual Nexus model. In addition they have also added the tilt feature like the actual Nexus. The Nexus bass mini only has one colour option.

                        All models feature a headphone out for those of you who really want to keep things quiet. When it comes to power you can choose to use 6 x AA batteries or purchase the official 12v DC power supply made for the Laney Minis.
